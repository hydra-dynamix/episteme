"""Full basin-stability + polysemy suite for the unlabeled-basin-relaxation branch.

Implements build-shape steps 2-5:
  2. perturbation stability test  (drop + corrupt modes)
  3. prefix-shared divergent families (from generator)
  4. polysemy disambiguation metric
  5. basin depth / phase-transition report

Held-out retrieval: index built on instances 0..k-2 of each family; instance k-1
is the held-out symbolically-novel query (port of the topology program's design).

Two variants indexed in parallel:
  typed     : edge labels kept (SUPPORTS/WEAKENS/...)
  labelfree : edge labels collapsed (pure topology, phase-8 question)

Headline metric shift (per branch thesis): NOT "did retrieval include the right
family" but "how much evidence can be removed/corrupted before the basin changes."
